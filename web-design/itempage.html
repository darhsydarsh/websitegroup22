                    Monopoly: Monopoly is a classic board game that involves players buying, selling, and trading properties to build wealth and bankrupt opponents.  
                    A stylised cityscape with a variety of locations and properties is included on the square board on which the game is played. By rolling dice, 
                    players move about the board and try to create houses and hotels by acquiring complete sets of properties that are the same colour. 
                    By enforcing rent when opponents land on owned property, the goal is to drive them insane. Chance and Community Chest cards, which can provide
                    unforeseen circumstances and financial difficulties, are also included in the game.

                    Scrabble: Scrabble is a word game where players use letter tiles to create words on a game board. The board consists of a grid with squares representing various point values. 
                    Every participant begins with a rack of alphabet tiles that are chosen at random from a pool. The objective is to build words on the board by joining words that already exist
                     and earning points by utilising the values of the letters. The game is played by taking turns between players until all the tiles are used or no more words can be constructed. 
                     Strategic depth is added by special squares on the board, such as the Double and Triple Letter/Word score spaces. At the conclusion of the game, the player with the highest score wins.
                      Scrabble is well-known for combining strategy, competitiveness, and linguistic skills.

                        Monopoly Classic sees players collecting property colour sets to start their empire. When you own all the properties in a colour group, you can start to build houses. The more you build, the higher the rent players who land on your property have to pay. Once a player has 4 houses on each property of a group, they can start building hotels to rake in even higher rents.
                        But other players are building their own empires – and if you can’t pay their rent, you could lose it all.
                        The Monopoly Classic game now features an updated line up of tokens, with the Rubber Ducky, T-Rex and Penguin now starring alongside old favourites like the Dog and Top Hat.

                    Uno: Uno is a popular card game known for its simplicity and fast-paced gameplay. The primary goal is to match the top card in the discard pile with a card of the same number or colour in order to be the first player to empty their hand. In addition to unique action cards that add new twists to the game like skip, reverse, and draw two cards,
                     players take turns playing a card. Once a player has one card remaining, the game becomes a race to shout "Uno" before the other player does. The wild cards let players select which colour to play next. Players who are caught by opponents before they can shout "Uno" have to draw extra cards.
